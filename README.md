There are three other text files in this folder, one for RSG, SSG, and FSG. They are all set to zero by default. If you would like to change it open the file and put your current number of attempts for that category.
Once that's done you can save them and you're good to go with the macros.
There are 3 macros in here, each having their respective name. RSG will not input any seed, FSG will paste your clipboard, and SSG will put the current SSG seed in. (2483313382402348964)
Do not run them all at once, I don't know what that would do but it would most likely break. If you are switching click the ^ symbol in the bottom right of your screen, right click on the green H and press Exit.
Now you should be good to go. I would recommend changing this folders name to something more identifiable.

Props to D4rkS0ulMC for the original macro, I just edited it.
